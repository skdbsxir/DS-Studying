# Basic Research on Graph Neural Networks

- This is my repository for researching various types of Graph Neural Networks.
- Works in **[Targets]** repositories are made by original authors.
	- Some practical codes(made by me) maybe added while researching.
- Using PyTorch Geometric (PyG), I'm adding some practical codes.
